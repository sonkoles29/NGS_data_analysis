# NGS data analysis

In this repository one can find Python scripts that I developped during my PhD studying the topology of sister chromatids. I do not reveal the final results until our data will be published. 

Analysis of Hi-C data using open2c tools: 

- [Generating Hi-C aggregate maps at CTCF sites](https://github.com/sonkoles29/NGS_data_analysis/blob/main/HiC_aggregate_maps_CTCF.ipynb)
- [Calculating contact probability curves](https://github.com/sonkoles29/NGS_data_analysis/blob/main/Normalized_scaling_plots.ipynb)

Analysis of ChIP-seq data: 

- [Generating CTCF centered stack-ups](https://github.com/sonkoles29/NGS_data_analysis/blob/main/Generate_stacks_around_CTCF.ipynb)

Analysis of NGS data using clustering and classification methods of machine learning:

- [Clustering of TAD boundaries in human HFF cells](https://github.com/sonkoles29/NGS_data_analysis/blob/main/Cluster_analysis_HFF_TAD_boundaries.ipynb)
