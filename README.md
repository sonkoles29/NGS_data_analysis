# NGS data analysis
During my PhD in Dr. Daniel Gerlich and Dr. Anton Goloborodko labs at IMBA, Vienna Biocenter I developed custom-based scripts to analyse NGS data for two projects on sister chromatid topology. 
In this repository you can find the example of the scripts. Until the results of my PhD work are published, I hide the actual results.
